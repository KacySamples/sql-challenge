# sql-challenge

# Description
For this challenge, I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. In summary: I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Tools 
To accomplish this analysis, I utilized tools such as my PC, PostgreSQL, Python, Notebook, GitHub, ChatGPT, Google and QuickDBD at the following address: https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/. 

# Human Resources 
My human resources were Dave with AskBCS, my classmates Mallorie, Tye, Jonathan, and Kirby. They are the best! We all spent hours on Zoom and Slack helping each other and leaning along the way. 

# Starter Code
The CSV files for this challenge were provided to us on BCS. 

# License
I do not believe I used any proprietary or licensed information for this challenge.
